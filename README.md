# asp.net-mvc5-webapi-angular2-cli-proxy-hybrid
ASP.NET MVC5 web project with _Spa folder containing Angular2-CLI folder.  Run the API, edit with VS Code, get live reloading.  NG2 app is configured with a proxy that falls back to the API server, and the API server falls back to the node server, to proxy the UI.  You can go to either server transparently, and it just works.
